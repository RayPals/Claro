Programming Language Written With AI For People With Learning Disabilities

Description:
•	I used A combination of different AI’s online to help develop this. It’s meant to be a simple scripting language for people with learning disabilities to understand, read and program in.

AI’s Used:
•	Meta AI
•	ChatGPT
•	Blackbox

Syntax Example:

Import the math library
IMPORT math

Variable assignment
VARIABLE x = 10
VARIABLE y = 20

Print statement
PRINT x
PRINT y

Using the math library to calculate the square root
VARIABLE sqrt_x = math.sqrt(x)
PRINT "Square root of x: " + str(sqrt_x)

If condition
IF x < y
    PRINT "x is less than y"
ELSE
    PRINT "x is not less than y"
END

While loop
VARIABLE counter = 0
WHILE counter < 5
    PRINT counter
    VARIABLE counter = counter + 1
END

For loop
LIST numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
FOR num IN numbers
    PRINT num
END

Function definition with parameters
FUNC add a b
    VARIABLE result = a + b
    PRINT result
END

Function call
CALL add 5 7

Handling input
INPUT name
PRINT "Hello, " + name

File operations
FILE WRITE test.txt "This is a test file."
FILE READ test.txt
PRINT test.txt

Try-except-finally block
TRY
    VARIABLE result = 10 / 0
    PRINT result
EXCEPT
    PRINT "An error occurred"
FINALLY
    PRINT "This will always execute"
END

Expectations:
I don’t expect a lot from this project, it would be cool to see people contribute to this project and to see if it were to go anywhere.
